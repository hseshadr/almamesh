# Third-Party Notices

AlmaMesh itself is released under the **MIT License** (see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE),
© 2026 Harish Seshadri). It ships, vendors, or syncs the third-party works listed
below, each under its own license. This file consolidates those attributions so a
downstream user has, in one place, the credit and license terms required for
redistribution.

Nothing here changes AlmaMesh's own MIT terms; it documents the obligations that
travel with the bundled dependencies.

## 1. Ephemeris data — JPL DE421 (`backend/de421.bsp`)

- **What:** The JPL Development Ephemeris **DE421** planetary/lunar ephemeris,
  shipped as a SPICE SPK kernel and synced into the browser inside the signed
  edge-proc bundle. It is the astronomical source of truth for every chart.
- **Origin:** Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology,
  for NASA — distributed via the NAIF (Navigation and Ancillary Information
  Facility) PDS node.
- **License / status:** Produced by a U.S. Government agency; JPL DE-series
  ephemerides are **in the public domain** and free to use. No copyright is
  asserted over the data.
- **Credit:** Please credit *JPL / NASA NAIF* (and cite Folkner, W. M., et al.,
  "The Planetary and Lunar Ephemeris DE 421," JPL IOM 343R-08-003, 2009) when
  reusing the ephemeris.

> Note: the `finals2000A.all` Earth-orientation file referenced by the bundle
> publisher is fetched at build time from IERS/USNO and is likewise not subject to
> copyright; it is not committed to this repository.

## 2. Astronomy Python wheels (`backend/offline_wheels/`)

Pure-Python (`py3-none-any`) wheels vendored so the in-browser Pyodide engine can
boot the Skyfield stack offline. All three are **MIT-licensed, © Brandon Rhodes**.

## 3. Fonts (`frontend/apps/web/public/fonts/`)

The self-hosted "Observatory" UI fonts are licensed under the **SIL Open Font
License, Version 1.1 (OFL-1.1)**. The full license text for each family ships
alongside the font files; the relevant files are:

- [`frontend/apps/web/public/fonts/OFL.txt`](./frontend/apps/web/public/fonts/OFL.txt) — Hanken Grotesk
- [`frontend/apps/web/public/fonts/OFL-Fraunces.txt`](./frontend/apps/web/public/fonts/OFL-Fraunces.txt) — Fraunces
- [`frontend/apps/web/public/fonts/OFL-SplineSansMono.txt`](./frontend/apps/web/public/fonts/OFL-SplineSansMono.txt) — Spline Sans Mono

| Font | License | Copyright |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Fraunces | OFL-1.1 | © 2020 The Fraunces Project Authors (github.com/undercasetype/Fraunces) |
| Hanken Grotesk | OFL-1.1 | © 2021 The Hanken Grotesk Project Authors (github.com/marcologous/hanken-grotesk) |
| Spline Sans Mono | OFL-1.1 | © 2022 The Spline Sans Mono Project Authors (github.com/SorkinType/SplineSansMono) |

Under the OFL, these fonts may be used, studied, modified, and redistributed
freely so long as they are not sold by themselves and the license/copyright
notices (the `OFL*.txt` files above) travel with them.

## 4. Sentence-embedding model — `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`

- **What:** A quantized ONNX export of `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`,
  used by `@almamesh/memory` for fully on-device (zero-egress) semantic chat
  recall via Transformers.js.
- **Where:** Weights live under
  `frontend/apps/web/public/models/Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/`. **This directory is
  a gitignored local/dev asset and is not committed to the repository** — it is
  downloaded during dev setup — so this notice (rather than an in-tree `LICENSE`
  file) records its terms.
- **License:** **Apache License 2.0.**
- **Credit:** `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` by the Sentence-Transformers
  / UKP authors (Nils Reimers et al.), derived from
  `nreimers/MiniLM-L6-H384-uncased`; ONNX conversion by the Xenova / Hugging Face
  Transformers.js project. See https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2.

## 5. Vendored first-/related-party packages

Each vendored package keeps its own `LICENSE` in place; consult those files for
the authoritative terms. In particular:

- **`shared-libs-python`** is MIT-licensed and **© 2025 Vector Management Team** —
  see [`backend/vendor/shared-libs-python/LICENSE`](./backend/vendor/shared-libs-python/LICENSE),
  reproduced verbatim:

- **`@edgeproc/browser`** is the owner's own code (from the edge-reco project),
  relicensed to **MIT** for this release — see
  [`frontend/packages/edgeproc-browser/LICENSE`](./frontend/packages/edgeproc-browser/LICENSE).

## 6. Offline city / location data (`frontend/apps/web/src/data/cities.min.json`)

- **What:** The bundled, offline city database that powers birth-location search.
  `frontend/scripts/generate-cities.mjs` pre-bakes a pruned, browser-ready
  `cities.min.json` (city names, coordinates, country, population) that is
  **committed to the repository as a static data asset**, so location entry
  resolves to latitude/longitude with zero network calls (no geocoding API).
- **Data origin & required attribution:** The city data is derived from
  **GeoNames** via the `all-the-cities` package (which in turn derives from the
  `cities-with-1000` GeoNames export). The GeoNames geographical database is
  licensed under **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)**
  and **requires attribution**. Please credit *GeoNames
  (https://www.geonames.org/), CC BY 4.0* when redistributing this data.

| Source | Role | License | Link |

| GeoNames | Geographical data (city names, coordinates, population) baked into `cities.min.json` | **CC BY 4.0 — attribution required** | https://www.geonames.org/ · https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ |
| `all-the-cities` 3.1.0 | Build-time npm package supplying the GeoNames-derived dataset | MIT | https://github.com/zeke/all-the-cities |

| `tz-lookup` 6.1.25 | Runtime library mapping latitude/longitude → IANA timezone offline | CC0-1.0 (public domain; no attribution required) | https://github.com/darkskyapp/tz-lookup |

## 7. Planet textures (`frontend/apps/web/public/planets/planet-*.jpg`)

- **What:** Equirectangular planet surface textures for the dashboard's 3D
  "force-field" hero, loaded at runtime by `PlanetMesh.tsx`. Committed under
  `frontend/apps/web/public/planets/` as
  `planet-{sun,moon,mercury,venus,mars,jupiter,saturn}.jpg`.
- **Origin & required attribution:** **Solar System Scope** planet textures
  (https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/), licensed under **Creative Commons
  Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)**
  (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) — free for any purpose,
  including commercial use, **with attribution**. Please credit *"Planet textures
  from Solar System Scope (CC BY 4.0)."*
- **Note:** The Rahu/Ketu lunar-node icons (`planet-rahu.png`, `planet-ketu.png`)
  are simple placeholder symbols generated locally by the repo's own
  `frontend/apps/web/public/planets/create-placeholders.sh` (ImageMagick); they
  are not third-party assets and carry no external attribution requirement.

The npm/PyPI dependencies pulled at install time (React, Vite, Tailwind, Zustand,
Pydantic, Pyodide, Transformers.js, etc.) carry their own licenses in their
respective package metadata; this file covers the works that are committed,
vendored, or synced as data/assets rather than resolved by a package manager.
