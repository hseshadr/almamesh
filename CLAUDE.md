# CLAUDE.md - AlmaMesh

AlmaMesh is a free, every-OS, anti-scam Vedic astrology app that runs **entirely
in the browser, local-first** — no backend, no accounts, no login, offline after
first load. The deterministic chart engine is the unchanged Python `almamesh`
package run under Pyodide (WebAssembly) in a Web Worker; it is byte-identical to
CPython. The React/Vite app is an installable PWA. The Python side is now a
**build-time bundle publisher** (the `almamesh-bundle` CLI) plus the engine — it
does NOT run as a server.

## Engineering standards (portfolio contract)

This repo builds against `~/dev/project-ideas/oss/ENGINEERING-STANDARDS.md`
(Published tier). Repo-specific declarations:

- **§8 (WASM/edge-compute): applicable — exemplar for pattern (a) Pyodide app
  engine.** The unchanged Python `almamesh` wheel runs in the browser tab under
  Pyodide, gated by golden byte-parity fixtures (`test:parity`); no browser-only
  forks of domain logic.
- **Documented toolchain exception — Bun instead of pnpm** (workspace + test
  runner): migrating the shipped Bun monorepo mid-development is
  high-risk/low-reward; a pnpm migration stays a labeled backlog item. Pinned in
  `frontend/.bun-version` (CI installs exactly that via `bun-version-file`;
  `engines.bun` sets the floor).
- **The gate** is `make gate` (dual-stack): fans out to `backend` (`uv run poe
  gate`: ruff lint → format check → mypy strict → xenon → pytest with coverage
  floor) and `frontend` (`bun run gate`: declarations
  build → typecheck → lint → unit tests → build). CI runs the same two commands
  — the gate and CI mirror exactly, both directions.
- **xenon grandfather (2026-07-11):** the gate pins `--max-absolute C
  --max-modules C --max-average A`. Pre-existing debt, to be ratcheted to A/A/A
  (punch list): 3 C blocks in `dasha/scoring.py`
  (`score_events_from_signals`, `apply_expert_rules`,
  `stitch_segments_into_events`; module rank C) and 14 B blocks across
  `dasha/{vimshottari,engine,chara}.py`, `rectification/{__init__,scorer}.py`,
  `rules/rule_types.py`. New code must be A; do not add to this list.
- **Playwright e2e tiering** (heavyweight suites split per §4, both lanes in CI):
  - **PR lane** (`test.yml`): the `exit-gate` job (hooked exit gate + i18n +
    precache + stubbed interpretation/chat-grounding/rectification/wizard specs
    + the REAL no-hooks onboarding & recovery drives) **plus the `e2e-smoke`
    job** — the 2 fastest keyless specs not already in the exit gate:
    `ai-settings.spec.ts` (settings wizard flow, no engine boot) and
    `report-pdf.e2e.spec.ts` (real onboarding → chart generation → rectify →
    PDF, no LLM key).
  - **Service-worker update lane** (`playwright.sw-update.config.ts`): the only
    gate that needs TWO builds — it serves build A, "deploys" build B on the
    same origin, and asserts that clicking the update banner leaves the browser
    executing B's entry chunk. Build the fixtures first
    (`node scripts/build-sw-update-fixtures.mjs`, ~6 min), then
    `bun run test:e2e:sw-update`. Deployed-SHA equality cannot replace this: on
    2026-08-01 `build.json` served the new SHA while every returning visitor ran
    the old chunks out of a stale precache.
  - **Nightly lane** (`nightly-e2e.yml`, cron + manual dispatch): all 12
    `e2e/*.spec.ts` suites — including the sw-update lane above, which is what
    makes it a gate rather than a command someone remembers to type — with the
    exit-gate job's flake engineering
    (Skyfield ephemeris + uv + Bun caches). The five `*.real.*` specs and the
    dual-voice B/C checks self-skip unless the optional `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
    repo secret is configured — a keyless nightly is still a green, honest run
    of the deterministic surface.
- **Release discipline:** Keep-a-Changelog + annotated tags, tag-forward-only.
  Tags start at v0.4.0 (v0.1.0–v0.3.0 were never cut; never backfill). Cut the
  tag at merged HEAD on main, never mid-PR.
- **Dependency audits are gates:** the weekly `security-audit.yml` runs both
  `pip-audit` against the exported uv lock and `bun audit` against the frozen
  frontend lock. A red schedule is a red repository; update or floor the
  vulnerable dependency and rerun the product gates before release.

## Project skills & agents

Invoke skills via the `Skill` tool; launch agents via `Task` with `subagent_type`.
(Serena MCP for semantic code nav/edit and the `MCP_DOCKER` browser for live
verification are also available — prefer them over grep / manual coding.)

| Skill | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `almamesh-backend` | Python engine + bundle publisher: sidereal calculations, dasha, yogas, signed bundle CLI |
| `almamesh-frontend` | React/TypeScript: components, styling, state, in-browser engine wiring |
| `testing` | Running tests, debugging failures, test infrastructure |
| `deployment` | CI/CD, env vars, cloud deployment |

These four are the only project-local skills (`.claude/skills/`); there are no
project-local agents. For agents, use the harness-provided types:

| Agent | Use For |
|-------|---------|
| `Explore` / `Plan` | Codebase exploration / implementation planning |
| `github-actions-agent` | CI/CD, PRs, workflow runs |

---

## Tech Stack

There is **no server**. The Python package is the deterministic engine and the
build-time bundle publisher; the browser app is the entire product surface.

| Layer | Tech | Version/Notes |
|-------|------|---------------|
| Engine | Python 3.13 `almamesh` pkg | Pydantic models; `uv` deps; runs on CPython AND under Pyodide (byte-identical) |
| Astronomy | Skyfield + DE421 ephemeris | Sidereal; Lahiri ayanamsa default, True-Chitra + True-node selectable; injectable `reference_date` for reproducibility; externally validated against astropy + JPL Horizons (sub-arcsecond, no Swiss Ephemeris) |
| Bundle publisher | `almamesh-bundle` CLI | Build-time: assembles + ed25519-signs a content-addressed edge-proc bundle (de421 + skyfield/pyodide wheels + almamesh wheel + provenance meta) |
| In-browser engine | Pyodide (WASM) in a Web Worker | `@almamesh/browser` — syncs the signed bundle into OPFS, boots the unchanged wheel, computes charts off the UI thread |
| Frontend | React + Vite + Tailwind CSS | Bun workspace monorepo; installable PWA (vite-plugin-pwa + service worker), offline after first load |
| LLM (optional) | Client-side, BYO endpoint | `@almamesh/llm` — **default: none** (chart is pure calculation); opt-in **cloud/BYO** (OpenRouter one-click preset, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint incl. a local Ollama); saving runs a real connectivity test (bad key/model reported immediately, never a silent no-op), PII-redacted, fail-closed `local_only` for local endpoints; never required to draw a chart |
| State | Zustand | Persisted stores (`@almamesh/store`) |
| i18n | react-i18next | Offline bundled en/es/pt catalogs (`apps/web/src/locales/*`, static-imported + SW-precached, zero-egress); persisted language Zustand store (`@almamesh/store` `useLanguageStore`) + `<html lang>` sync; AI narrates in-language; en authoritative, es/pt machine-translated |
| Tests | Vitest (unit) + Playwright (live-browser exit gate) | |

### Frontend monorepo packages (`frontend/packages/*`)

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| `@almamesh/shared-types` | UI-facing TS contract (`ChartData`, etc.) |
| `@almamesh/constants` | Single design-token source (colors/typography/astrology) + Tailwind preset |
| `@almamesh/browser` | In-browser engine: edge-proc bundle sync (OPFS) + Pyodide chart Worker + `AlmaMeshRuntime` |
| `@almamesh/store` | Zustand stores + pure adapters: `chart` (`SiderealChart → ChartData`, incl. the D9 Navamsa `varga_ctx`), `chartGeometry` (`buildChartGeometry` → N/S kundli, `buildVargaGeometry` → D9), `energy` (`buildEnergyFrame(chart, t)` → 3D force-field), `profiles` store (rename/delete with chart cascade) + **`members`** (typed relationships, persist-v1 migration), **`mesh`** (per-pair `MeshEdgeContext` from `compute_mesh`, read-only) and the persisted **`interpretation`** readings store (IndexedDB `almamesh-interpretations`, provenance-stamped, profile-owned readings) |
| `@almamesh/llm` | Interpretation + multi-turn chat, **no AI by default**. Opt-in **cloud/BYO** only: any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`engine: "openai-http"`) — a one-click **OpenRouter** preset (`cloud_premium`, stronger models) or a local Ollama-style endpoint. `testProviderConnection` runs a real connectivity probe on save that **mirrors the JSON-mode reading** (`chatCompletionJson`: json `response_format` + a "json" prompt, no `max_tokens` — so a GPT-5-family reasoning model whose ≥16 output floor rejects a 1-token cap is no longer falsely reported unreachable, and a json-mode-incapable model can't falsely pass; the settings UI reports Connected or a specific error — bad key / bad model / out of credits / **rate-limited (429)** / **provider outage (5xx)** / unreachable — via `classifyConnectionError`, with the provider's own reason surfaced on an otherwise-opaque failure via `connectionErrorDetail`). Any hand-typed `openrouter.ai` endpoint is normalized to the canonical `/api/v1` base at the single `resolveProviderConfig` resolution point (so `https://openrouter.ai/` "just works" for the probe, the reading, and chat). The AI-settings model fields are a **searchable `ModelCombobox`** fed by OpenRouter's live catalog (`fetchOpenRouterModels`, a keyless public read gated to OpenRouter) so an invalid slug can't be entered, while free-typing survives for local/custom models. `fetchOpenRouterCredits` surfaces the account balance. PII-redacted, fail-closed `local_only` for local endpoints. (The former on-device WebLLM tier was removed — `@mlc-ai/web-llm` is gone.) **Mesh narration** (`mesh-reading`/`mesh-facts`/`mesh-sanitize`): role-anonymized pair sanitizer (no names leave the device) + 3-section `streamMeshReading` behind the **ANTI-SCAM RELATIONSHIP FENCE** (band = convention, never a verdict) |
| `@almamesh/memory` | In-browser, zero-egress **semantic chat memory (RAG)**: `chunkText` + on-device embeddings (`@huggingface/transformers`, self-hosted weights, confined to a Web Worker via `createWorkerEmbedder`) + IndexedDB vector store (`idb-keyval`) + cosine retrieval. The `ChatMemory` facade (`indexMessage`/`retrieve`, per-profile) backs chat recall + `ChatSearch` in `apps/web` (`lib/chatMemory.ts`). No network, offline-first; tests inject a stub `Embedder` so the model runtime never loads |
| `apps/web` | The React/Vite "Observatory" PWA: UI primitives (`components/ui/`), `AppLayout`, N/S charts, `forcefield/` 3D hero, self-hosted fonts (no CDN) |

(`@almamesh/api-client` and `@almamesh/hooks` were DELETED with the SaaS runtime.)

## Rules (project-specific — the global engineering defaults also apply)

1. **Local-first, no server** — No FastAPI/DB/auth. Compute stays on-device; the network is delivery-only (signed bundle).
2. **Engine math lives in Python** — The TS adapter RESHAPES `SiderealChart → ChartData` only; never reimplement astrology in TypeScript.
3. **Determinism** — Same inputs → byte-identical chart on CPython and Pyodide, where the inputs are all four of `(datetimeUtc, latitude, longitude, referenceDate)`. `referenceDate` is REQUIRED at the worker boundary — never optional, never a wall-clock fallback (that gap is what made the shipped chart differ run to run). Mint it once per generation with `newChartReferenceInstant()` and pass the same value to `toBirthInput` and `siderealChartToChartData`.

(On top of these: the global defaults — tools/skills-first, parallel superpower
agents, library-first, minimal code, TDD, type-safety, test-always, no dead code.)

---

## Data Contract (no API; it's a transform + signed bundle)

There is no HTTP API. The "contract" is the in-process chart pipeline plus the
signed bundle layout the browser syncs:

```
Python  calculate_sidereal_context() -> SiderealContext   (backend/src/almamesh/)
   │  same entrypoint runs under Pyodide, byte-identical
   ▼
TS engine  SiderealChart                                   (@almamesh/browser, ./pyodide/chart)
   │  pure reshape + timezone only — NO astrology
   ▼
store adapters (pure, NO astrology)                        (@almamesh/store, src/adapters/)
   ├─ chart.ts        SiderealChart -> ChartData           (the UI contract; incl. D9 varga_ctx)
   ├─ chartGeometry.ts buildChartGeometry(chart)           (N/S kundli geometry; + buildVargaGeometry for D9)
   ├─ energy.ts       buildEnergyFrame(chart, t)           (3D force-field frame)
   └─ predictive.ts   reshape PredictiveContexts           (transits/vargas/strength/domains -> UI)
   ▼
UI  ChartData / shared-types                               (@almamesh/shared-types)

Predictive layer (the "Sky & Timing" surface, computed on-device, off the natal
chart path): a lazy second engine entry `edge/chart_runtime.py::compute_predictive`
-> `predictive.py::compute_predictive_contexts` emits transits/Gochara, dasha depth
(antar/pratyantar), all 16 vargas D1–D60, Ashtakavarga + Shadbala, and per-life-domain
forecasts. It flows through `@almamesh/browser` (pyodide/predictive.ts) ->
`@almamesh/store` (adapters/predictive.ts + the `usePredictiveStore`) -> shared-types
-> the `/predictive` route, the dashboard timing section, and report sections VIII–XI.
Same determinism + byte-parity rules apply (transit + predictive golden fixtures).

Mesh layer (the relational surface, computed on-device, off the natal chart path):
a lazy engine entry `edge/chart_runtime.py::compute_mesh` ->
`mesh/edge.py::compute_mesh_edge(a, b, relationship) -> MeshEdgeContext` — relations
BETWEEN charts, never mutations of either natal chart. It flows through
`@almamesh/browser` (pyodide/mesh.ts) -> `@almamesh/store` (adapters/mesh.ts +
`useMeshStore.ensureMeshEdge`) -> shared-types -> the `/mesh` constellation and
`/mesh/:memberId` edge view. Sections are CURATED BY RELATIONSHIP: Ashtakoota +
Mangal are marriage tables (spouse/partner edges only); friend/family/business
edges lead with Graha Maitri — `scripts/verify-mesh.mjs` asserts both paths live.

Rectification layer (the birth-time authority surface, computed on-device, off the natal
chart path): a lazy engine entry `edge/chart_runtime.py::compute_rectification` ->
`rectification/` package -> `compute_rectification_result` emits `RectificationResult`
(ranked `RectificationCandidate` list, qualitative `RectificationBand` per result,
per-event `EventEvidence` table). Wire input: 17 `LifeEventCategory` values (Spec 062 E6,
incl. `family_rupture`) + optional `spanMinutes` (bounded ±window) + `AnchorConfidence`
(`'about' | 'unknown'`). Two modes: `cusp` (2 adjacent signs near a cusp, ~sub-second)
and `window` (bounded ±window via `spanMinutes`, or whole-day when the time is unknown;
warm-astronomy reuse, ~0.6s). Ascendant-dependent signals: dasha-lord↔house-lordship
match + transit-to-house at event dates + D9 lagna signals. Candidates carry a labeled
score anatomy — `fitScore`, `navamsaLagnaSign`, `positiveTotal`/`penaltyTotal` split, `priorBonus`
(the weak anchor prior, never hidden in the score), `misses` (form-1 unexplained +
form-2 silent-activation). Honest confidence: margin→band, min-evidence gate forces
`near_tie`, de-correlation caps stacked same-category events; the optional aggregate
`confidencePct` is a calibrated best-vs-runner-up fit margin, never the probability that
a birth time is correct. Engine
computes; the LLM only optionally structures. It flows through `@almamesh/browser`
(pyodide/rectification.ts, `ChartEngine.computeRectification`) -> `@almamesh/store`
(adapters/rectification.ts reshape + transient `useRectificationStore`; extended
`lifeEvents` store with date+category+persist-v1 migration; `rectificationRecords`
store persists a display-only record — v2 adds `resultSnapshot` + `eventSummaries` so
the evidence story survives revisits) -> shared-types (`RectificationResult`/
`RectificationCandidate`/`EventEvidence`/`LifeEventCategory`/`RectificationMode`/
`RectificationBand`/`AnchorConfidence`) -> the `/rectify/:profileId` wizard (3 entry
CTAs: onboarding unknown-time, ProfileSettings panel, dashboard cusp callout) and the
report: the comprehensive PDF + web report render Section XII "Birth Time Authority"
(`buildRectificationPdf` — facts, candidate table, per-event evidence). Confirm routes
through the existing birth-info-changed→regenerate pipeline so the rectified time becomes
the working authority. LLM grounding is optional and consented: `structureLifeEvents` +
`RECTIFICATION_FENCE` produce an untrusted `CanonicalLifeEventDraft` with date, category,
precision, and an optional concise summary. The summary is potentially identifying and
local/display-only; the engine receives the narrower `RectificationEventInput` projection
with no summary. The configured structurer necessarily sees the user's source narrative
after the existing egress/privacy gate; do not call that path PII-free. Every onboarding
entry path still needs the same explicit draft-confirm gate before the full
draft→canonical pattern can be claimed complete. The
interview (`streamRectificationInterview`) carries a gathered-state block of
`{date, category, precision}` rows only, and `gatherEventsFromTurn` returns a
discriminated ok/error result so a failed extraction is never silently dropped; chart
chat receives a PII-safe record slice (band + entered/working signs + mode, no
times/dates/margins); interpretation + chat also compose the persisted raw predictive
contexts (the active predictive pipeline) via `withRawPredictive`. Same determinism +
byte-parity rules: pin `reference_date`; Pyodide==CPython parity gate covers the new
entry; golden fixtures use synthetic natives only (no real birth data).

Optional interpretation + chat (off the chart path): @almamesh/llm — NO AI by
default (the chart is pure calculation). Opt-in is cloud/BYO only: any
OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`engine:'openai-http'`) — a one-click OpenRouter
preset (stronger) or a local Ollama-style endpoint. Saving in Settings → AI runs
a real connectivity probe (`testProviderConnection`) against the exact
model/endpoint the reading will use — a faithful stand-in that mirrors the
JSON-mode reading body (no `max_tokens` cap), so a bad key / bad model /
out-of-credits / rate-limited / provider-outage / unreachable endpoint is
reported immediately (with the provider's own reason) instead of a silent no-op. PII-redacted,
fail-closed local_only for local endpoints. The chart engine is zero-egress;
there are exactly TWO deliberate network egresses (besides one-way bundle/app
delivery): (1) the optional AI calls the user opts into (the configured
endpoint), and (2) **birthplace search** — the typed city string is sent to the
Open-Meteo geocoding API (keyless, CORS) to resolve coordinates + IANA timezone,
online-primary with an offline fallback to the bundled `cities.min.json` list
(`lib/geo/onlineGeocoder.ts` + `searchCities` in `lib/geo/cityLookup.ts`). Only
the city name leaves the device — never the birth date/time, name, or chart.
Privacy copy is scoped accordingly (landing/legal/mesh say "birth date, time,
and chart never leave"; the privacy policy discloses the geocoder as touchpoint
#2). NOTE: the engine emits the
full D1–D60 varga set; the adapter populates `varga_ctx` (D9 Navamsa rendered in
both kundli styles + the print report, D1–D60 in the predictive "Divisional Charts"
tab) and the predictive contexts above.

Dual-voice reading (shipped): `VedicInterpretation.summary`
is now a `Persona { layman: string; technical: string }` instead of a plain string —
`personaText(summary, audience)` selects the voice at the render boundary so toggling
"For You"/"For Astrologer" switches the headline without a new LLM call. The dashboard
mounts the FULL reading, not just the summary:
`apps/web/src/components/features/dashboard/DashboardInterpretation.tsx` (rendered by
`pages/Dashboard.tsx`) uses progressive disclosure — the core narrative (strengths →
challenges → life themes) is always visible; yogas, the seven life-area guidances,
remedies and the road ahead are closed-by-default in-place collapsibles. It computes
NO astrology and makes NO LLM call: it reuses the report layer's pure selectors
(`personaText`, `buildGuidanceSections`), and the `audience` prop drives every
section. The Life Atlas
(`LifeAtlas.tsx`) and Sky & Timing panel both use `usePredictiveLayer({ auto: true })`,
auto-starting the ~30s predictive compute the moment engine + chart are ready (no manual
button); the single Pyodide engine thread services chart + predictive calls sequentially,
so any concurrent engine use (e.g. rectification live preview) must wait its turn.

Signed bundle (delivery):  ed25519-signed, content-addressed origin
   de421.bsp + finals2000A.all + pyodide/skyfield/almamesh wheels + provenance meta
   published by  almamesh-bundle  ->  synced into OPFS by  @almamesh/browser
```

When changing the contract: update the Python model → update `SiderealChart` →
update the store adapter → update `@almamesh/shared-types` → run the byte-parity
gate (`test:parity`) and the live exit gate.

## Quality Gates (Non-Negotiable)

All changes must pass before completion:
- `uv run pytest` — engine tests pass (incl. DE421 golden-parity fixture)
- `uv run ruff check .` + `uv run ruff format --check .` — clean, formatted
- `bun run --filter '*' typecheck` — frontend types clean
- `bun run test:unit` (Vitest) green; the Pyodide==CPython `test:parity` gate green
- Human-consumed PDFs pass the maximal-report artifact gate: Poppler text extraction proves
  every supported section and final row; Poppler bounding boxes prove A4 content/footer
  bounds, footer separation, page counters, and heading+first-row cohesion; representative
  rendered pages are visually inspected after layout/renderer/font changes. Run those checks
  against both the Node render and the actual Playwright-downloaded browser PDF: browser font
  metrics can paginate differently. Dense, variable-length sections use an explicit page planner
  with bounded unbreakable groups; never trust nested renderer auto-wrap to protect the footer.
  Non-empty bytes are not evidence of a correct report. (Scar 2026-07-13: the Node maximal PDF
  was clean while the browser download stacked Vimshottari rows through the page-6 footer.)
- `node scripts/verify-precache-redirect.mjs` (after a build) green — serves `dist` through a Cloudflare-like `.html`→canonical **308** server and asserts every SW precache URL resolves 200 with no redirect (the gate that reproduces the prod-only wedge `vite preview` can't; wired into CI in `.github/workflows/test.yml`)
- The app **builds and previews** (`bun run build && bun run preview`) — remember module Workers do NOT run under `vite dev`
- **Validate end-to-end live** (the global non-negotiable): drive the built+previewed app and observe every touched journey (reachable + correct on screen + clean console). AlmaMesh specifics: module Workers need a **production build**; the `MCP_DOCKER` browser **cannot boot the engine** — use the project's Playwright Chromium / the live exit gate; browser-in-Docker reaches the host as `http://host.docker.internal:<port>`. Run the live exit gate after backend/bundle/chunk changes. (Two scars that shipped CI-green: an OpenRouter selector with no reachable UI, and a timezone bug in the print header — hence "reachable + correct on the actual screen," not just a green unit test.)
- **Drive the REAL `make demo` artifact through REAL onboarding — the hooked exit gate is necessary but NOT sufficient.** The `verify-*.mjs` gates build with `VITE_EXIT_GATE_HOOKS=1` and seed the chart via the `window.__almameshGenerate` hook, which **bypasses the actual onboarding → engine-bootstrap → Generate → dashboard journey**. A green hooked gate has shipped a broken real path. So before claiming any user-facing change works: build **without** hooks (`bun run build`, or `wrangler pages dev dist` for closest-to-prod) and drive the real UI in the project's Playwright Chromium — type name + birth date/time, search & select a city, click **Generate**, **WAIT for the ~38 MB engine bootstrap to finish**, and confirm a chart renders on `/dashboard` with a clean console. Also exercise the **unhappy boot paths** — a throttled/slow bootstrap and a failed/stale bundle — and confirm the user can **recover in-app** (re-bootstrap / "Reset & reload"), never a dead-end "engine still warming up" card. **Engine-recovery invariant:** the in-browser bootstrap is RETRYABLE (`AlmaMeshRuntimeProvider` exposes `reboot()`/`whenReady()`) and every "engine not ready" surface must offer in-app recovery — never leave a returning visitor permanently stuck. (Scar 2026-06-19: an "immaculate" pass shipped with the hooked exit gate 8/8 green while the real onboarding was permanently stuck on "Connection Issue" — a fire-once `useEffect([])` bootstrap with no retry.) **Session self-heal invariant (PR #45):** a wedged service-worker session (SW controls the page but its app-shell precache is empty/stale — the "site down" residue of a mid-deploy cache race) must AUTO-recover with no user action: `swSelfHeal.ts` runs a boot probe (`healStrandedServiceWorker`) + a global chunk-error recovery (`installChunkErrorRecovery`) + `lazyWithRetry` route imports, each loop-guarded to reload at most once/session and each PRESERVING the `*-immutable` engine caches + OPFS (never a 38 MB re-download); the chunk-aware `ErrorBoundary` is the last-resort visible card. The prerendered `*.html` shells are precached under their **extensionless canonical URLs** (CF Pages 308-redirects the `.html` forms; a redirecting precache key is the wedge's root cause). Scar 2026-07-10: a green CI shipped this wedge because the exit gates run against `vite preview` (serves `.html` 200), never CF's `.html`→canonical 308.
