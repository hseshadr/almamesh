"""Typed Pydantic contract for the per-life-domain predictive SYNTHESIS layer.

This is the prose-free, deterministic fusion of the four predictive subsystems
(natal ``SiderealContext`` + ``TransitContext`` + ``VargaContext`` +
``StrengthContext``) into one ``LifeDomainForecast`` for each facet of life. The
engine fuses signals and CITES the classical rule it applied; the LLM/i18n layer
narrates later. Calc-integrity: any value that is a documented simplification
carries an explicit ``approximated`` flag rather than shipping a guess as fact.

Like the transit/varga/strength contexts, this is a SEPARATE, additive object
built READ-ONLY off already-computed contexts — it is NOT nested into the natal
output, so the natal golden and CPython<->Pyodide byte-parity stay untouched (a
later integration wave composes it). All enums are closed sets serialized as
their ``.value`` for the browser.

Exposed via this module's own symbols; the package ``domains`` re-exports the
public entrypoint. A shared ``schemas/__init__`` is intentionally NOT edited.
