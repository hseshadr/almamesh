"""The LAZY predictive superset: transits + all vargas + strength + life domains.

This is the second runtime entrypoint next to ``calculate_sidereal_context``.
It is computed SEPARATELY from the natal chart call (transits take ~35s under
Pyodide), at an EXPLICIT reference instant — never a silent ``now()`` — so the
payload is byte-reproducible on CPython and Pyodide alike. The natal pipeline
and its golden stay untouched.

This module is deliberately free of any ``edgeproc`` dependency so the Pyodide
chart Worker (which installs only the skyfield stack + the almamesh wheel) can
import it directly; ``edge/chart_runtime.py`` wraps it for task payloads.

CRYPTO-FREE BY DESIGN. This module computes; it does not sign. Each domain's
``StrengthSummary`` is sealed into an Ed25519 receipt by the Worker's TypeScript
(``@edgeproc/avow``), outside Pyodide — see
``frontend/packages/browser/src/pyodide/strengthReceipt.ts`` for why, and
``tests/test_engine_is_crypto_free.py`` for the guard that keeps it that way.
