"""Saturn sign-cusp ingress timing with retrograde correctness.

Saturn spends ~2.5y per sign but retrogrades ~140 days/yr, so it can cross a sign
cusp up to 3x before settling. The canonical *entry* into a sign is the LAST
forward crossing of that cusp (spec section 3.2/3.6). Everything here is pure and
deterministic — the instant is always passed in; no `now()`."""
