"""The Python half of the cross-language strength-receipt conformance proof.

The engine computes each domain's ``StrengthSummary`` in Python; the browser
Worker SIGNS it in TypeScript (``@edgeproc/avow``). That split is only sound if
both sides canonicalize a subject to the SAME bytes and sign it to the SAME
Ed25519 signature.

``testdata/vectors/domain-strength-receipt.json`` is the shared proof. This module
asserts the vectors really are what the Python ``avow`` kernel produces; the
TypeScript suite (``@almamesh/browser``'s ``strengthReceipt.test.ts``) asserts the
TS signer reproduces them, and that it verifies Python-minted receipts. Neither
half is meaningful alone — together they pin the byte-compatibility that licenses
signing outside Pyodide.

``avow`` is a TEST-ONLY dependency here: it is the oracle, never engine code.
``test_engine_is_crypto_free.py`` fails the build if ``src/almamesh`` ever imports
it.
