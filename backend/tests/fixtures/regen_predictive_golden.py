"""Regenerate tests/fixtures/predictive_golden_de421.json deterministically.

Run: ``uv run python -m tests.fixtures.regen_predictive_golden``. Recomputes the
pinned composed PredictiveContexts for each case and rewrites the golden. Birth
instants, places and the single reference instant are all fixed (they must
match ``tests/test_predictive_golden.py`` AND
``frontend/packages/browser/integration/parity.mjs``); the engine is
deterministic, so the output is reproducible. Regenerate only on an intentional
engine change.
