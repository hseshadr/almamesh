"""Guard: the Python engine is CRYPTO-FREE, in every runtime.

WHY this exists (the scar): the in-browser predictive path broke three times along
the same fault line. First ``almamesh.domains`` eagerly re-exported the receipt
helpers, forcing ``import avow`` -> ``pynacl`` at module load. Then
``almamesh.predictive`` — one level UP, where nothing guarded it — reintroduced an
identical module-level ``from avow import SignedReceipt``, and the app died at the
first online Life Atlas compute. Both were patched by making the crypto import lazy.

The third failure retired the lazy-import strategy altogether: PyNaCl's compiled
``_sodium`` extension does not register under this app's Pyodide boot AT ALL (plain
``nacl``, ``cffi`` and ``_cffi_backend`` load fine; only the dylib fails), so no
amount of deferring could make in-Pyodide signing work. Signing therefore moved OUT
of Python into the Worker's TypeScript (``@edgeproc/avow``, pure JS Ed25519), and
the invariant hardened from "import crypto lazily" to:

    NOTHING under ``almamesh`` may import ``avow`` or ``nacl``. Ever. Anywhere.

That is both stronger and simpler than the old lazy-import contract, and it is what
lets the browser boot drop the ``pynacl`` package entirely.

The Worker entry points are PARSED OUT OF ``chartWorker.ts`` rather than hardcoded,
so a new Worker entry point automatically inherits the guard instead of silently
escaping it — which is exactly how ``predictive`` escaped last time.
