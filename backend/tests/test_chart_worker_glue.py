"""The SHIPPED browser glue, executed under CPython.

``PY_BOOTSTRAP`` in ``frontend/packages/browser/src/pyodide/chartWorker.ts`` is
the exact Python the Pyodide chart Worker runs in the browser. Every other
engine test calls ``calculate_sidereal_context`` directly and passes a
``reference_date`` the shipped path never passed -- so the suite proved the
reference instant is INJECTABLE and never that it is INJECTED. See
``test_dasha_reference_date.py``: its four tests all hand the engine an
explicit instant, so a chart path that silently read the wall clock sailed
through every one of them.

This module closes that gap by reading the glue OUT of the TypeScript file and
running it, so there is no second copy to drift (a rule written twice in two
languages diverges; a rule read once cannot).

The two user-facing claims under test:

- README "chart computation remains local and deterministic"
- docs/ARCHITECTURE "same inputs -> byte-identical chart on CPython and Pyodide"

Both are true only if the reference instant is one of the recorded inputs.
Three properties make that so, and each fails on its own:

1. The instant is LOAD-BEARING -- two instants give two different charts. This
   is what makes (2) and (3) non-vacuous: without it, "refuses to guess" could
   be satisfied by a hardcoded constant that silently freezes every user's
   dasha.
2. The glue REFUSES a payload with no ``referenceDate`` rather than
   substituting ``now()`` -- the rule ``_almamesh_compute_predictive`` already
   enforces, now enforced on the natal path too.
3. Given the instant, the glue reads NO clock: the same payload computed thirty
   years apart on the wall clock is byte-identical.

Plus the cross-language oracle: the glue reproduces the committed CPython
golden, so "the browser path" and "the trusted backend" are the same numbers.
