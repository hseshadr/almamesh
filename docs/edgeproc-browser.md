# Standalone `@edgeproc/browser` provenance

**TL;DR:** AlmaMesh consumes the generic signed-bundle browser engine from its
public repository at one exact Git commit. This repository keeps only a thin
AlmaMesh adapter: a consumer-owned Worker entry, the historical cache layout,
and exit-gate observability.

## Pinned source

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Repository | `https://github.com/hseshadr/edgeproc-browser` |
| Package | `@edgeproc/browser` |
| Commit | `a94e7f2a0237a7144658351c07cb296fcb0540fb` |
| License | MIT |
| Consumer manifests | `frontend/packages/browser/package.json`, `frontend/packages/memory/package.json` |
| Reproducible lock | `frontend/bun.lock` |

The Git commit includes deterministic `dist/` output for Bun's exact-Git
bootstrap path. The upstream gate rebuilds it and fails if the committed output
differs. Registry publication can replace this bootstrap path later without
changing the public API.

## Boundary owned here

- `frontend/packages/browser/src/edgeproc.worker.ts` is the one-line,
  consumer-owned Vite Worker entry.
- `frontend/packages/browser/src/edgeprocClient.ts` adapts AlmaMesh's legacy
  four-argument sync port, preserves the `edgeproc-browser-cache` /
  `content-addressed-cache` / `:` IndexedDB layout, and maps the private
  exit-gate fallback hook to the shared typed storage option.
- `frontend/packages/browser/src/pyodide/` remains AlmaMesh product code: it
  loads the signed chart assets and boots the Pyodide chart Worker.

Generic signature verification, bounded fetch/decompression, content-addressed
sync, OPFS/IndexedDB persistence, locking, Worker protocol, and vector adapters
live only in the standalone package.

`frontend/packages/memory/src/vectorStore.ts` is a second thin domain adapter:
it maps chat chunks to flat SQLite metadata, applies the durable dataset
generation fence, and delegates all live similarity, scoped deletion, and OPFS
persistence to `@edgeproc/browser/vector/sqlite`.

## Upgrade gate

1. Pin a reviewed 40-character upstream commit in the manifest, Bun lock, and
   Dagger contract.
2. Run the complete frontend gate.
3. Build the real Vite app and confirm it emits one signed-bundle Worker asset
   and one SQLite-vector Worker asset.
4. Run the Chromium parity journey and both WebKit persistence journeys. They
   prove warm OPFS reuse, forced IndexedDB fallback using the historical layout,
   offline reload, trust-root refresh, and exactly one sync Worker asset.
5. Run the security audit and secret scan before merge.

The browser gate also writes, searches, disposes, reopens, and searches a real
OPFS SQLite vector index in Chromium. That is the consumer proof that the exact
Git artifact contains runnable SQLite and sqlite-vector assets, not merely
passing mocked adapter tests. The WebKit leg capability-probes OPFS: Playwright
WebKit currently throws `UnknownError` while opening the root, so AlmaMesh must
return the stable `memory.opfs_unavailable` refusal without spawning a Worker or
falling back to a weaker index. Authoritative chat remains usable.
