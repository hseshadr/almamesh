# Event-based birth-time rectification — design spec

**Status:** approved design (2026-06-26). Branch `feat/rectification-authority`. Phase 2 of
rectification-as-authority. Phase 1 (engine cusp fields + honest as-recorded/rectified UX) already
shipped at `0fdc3d9`.

**Shipped:** 2026-06-27. All 4 slices landed: contract+store+entry UI; cusp engine+results+confirm;
window/unknown-time mode; optional LLM accelerator (`structureLifeEvents` + `RECTIFICATION_FENCE`).
Gates green: backend pytest, parity 14/14, frontend typecheck + Vitest. Live-validated end-to-end
for both cusp and unknown-time modes on synthetic natives. The `/rectify/:profileId` wizard is
reachable from 3 CTAs (onboarding, ProfileSettings, dashboard cusp callout); confirm routes through
the existing birth-info-changed→regenerate pipeline. The e2e spec (`wizard-phase2.spec.ts`) is a
manually-run live gate (same pattern as `verify-*.mjs`), not wired to CI.

## TL;DR

A `/rectify` wizard. The user enters **dated, categorized** life events. The **Python engine** scores
candidate rising signs against them using the ascendant-dependent signals that actually discriminate
(dasha-lord ↔ house-lordship match + transit-to-house at the event date). The result is an **honest
qualitative ranking with per-event evidence and a margin — never a single percentage**. The human
confirms; the chosen time becomes the working authority through the existing Phase-1 regenerate
pipeline. Two modes in one wizard: **cusp** (2 candidate signs) and **window / unknown-time** (rank the
plausible rising signs).

## Context & trigger

Two reports for the same birth (30 Mar 1973, recorded 05:45, Vadodara) diverged **only** on the Lagna,
because the two times straddle the Aquarius/Pisces ascendant cusp (recorded 05:45 → Aquarius 28.82°,
~4 min from the boundary; rectified ~06:00 → Pisces 3.8°). Whole-sign houses then rotate one sign,
cascading the whole interpretation. The engine is byte-identical and correct — there is no bug. The
external Bayesian "Pisces 57%" was a coin-flip with false precision. The product principle (owner's,
standing): recorded times are unreliable, **event-based rectification is the legitimate way to find the
true ascendant, the rectified time is the working authority, both times are always shown, and
confidence must be shown honestly** — a near-tie is a labeled hypothesis, never a verdict.

## Goals

- Let a user resolve their rising sign from **dated life events**, on-device, deterministically.
- Cover both the **near-cusp 2-candidate** case (closes the original trigger) and the
  **unknown / rough time** case (today a dead-end that silently defaults to 12:00).
- Make the rectified time the **working authority** on human confirmation, with **both times always
  shown** (reuse the Phase-1 pipeline).
- Be **structurally honest**: qualitative bands, per-event evidence, a margin, an explicit
  "uncalibrated heuristic; a near-tie is settled only by a recorded time" note. Never a headline %.

## Non-goals

- No exact-minute claim. Events resolve the rising **sign** (house rotation), not the birth minute.
- No LLM computation of astrology. The LLM, if used at all, only structures free text into reviewable
  rows. The deterministic engine computes everything.
- No automatic application. Rectification is always **human-confirmed** ("rectify to choose", never
  "we found your true time").
- No server. On-device, local-first, zero-egress by default (LLM assist is opt-in).

## The honesty spine (fixed constraints — not trade-offs)

1. **Sign, not minute.** Output is "your rising sign is most consistent with X" + a *representative*
   time. The UI states minute-level precision is not resolvable from events.
2. **No headline %.** Result = ranked candidates + qualitative band
   (`near_tie` / `leans` / `consistent`) + the margin between the top two + a per-event evidence table
   + the honesty line.
3. **Min-evidence gate.** Below a threshold of *discriminating* events, the wizard refuses to rank and
   says so, rather than fabricating confidence.
4. **Engine computes; LLM only optionally structures.** The privacy boundary is the structured form —
   the engine sees only `{date, category}`. LLM assist is opt-in, behind the existing cloud fence, with
   the typed output (name-free by construction) as the boundary.
5. **Determinism + parity + PII.** Pin `reference_date` and the dasha year-convention; the
   Pyodide==CPython parity gate covers the new entry; golden fixtures use the **synthetic Bengaluru cusp
   native only** — never the owner's real birth data. TDD + 3-way i18n (en/es/pt) throughout.

## Architecture

### 1. Engine scorer — `backend/src/almamesh/rectification/` + `edge/chart_runtime.py::compute_rectification`

The discrimination physics (confirmed against the engine): dasha *timing* is Moon-driven and therefore
ascendant-invariant, but **whether a dated period is "about" marriage / career / children depends on
house lordships, which rotate when the ascendant flips a sign.** Transit-to-house at the event date
rotates too. These are the signals that distinguish Aquarius-rising from Pisces-rising for the same day.

Per candidate ascendant, reusing **one warm `SkyfieldAstronomy`** (not a DE421 reload per candidate):

1. Resolve the active dasha lords (MD / AD / PD) at each event date from the natal Vimshottari tree
   (`VimshottariDashaData`; timing is ascendant-invariant).
2. Map the event category → classical house(s) over the existing `EventType` enum
   (`backend/src/almamesh/constants/astrology.py:51`): e.g. MARRIAGE/ENGAGEMENT → 7; CHILDBIRTH → 5;
   CAREER_CHANGE/PROMOTION/JOB_LOSS/BUSINESS_START → 10 (with 2/11 for gains); RELOCATION → 4/12;
   PROPERTY_PURCHASE → 4; HEALTH_ISSUE/SURGERY → 6 (8 for surgery); HIGHER_STUDIES → 4/5/9;
   LITIGATION → 6; WINDFALL → 2/11; EXPENSE_SHOCK → 12. (Exact map finalized in the scorer with
   citations; this is the seed.)
3. **Discriminator (primary):** does an active dasha lord rule or occupy the category's house(s) in
   *this candidate chart*? House lordship rotates with the ascendant, so the same active lord scores
   differently per candidate. (The forward logic already exists in
   `backend/src/almamesh/dasha/vimshottari.py` `_extract_vim_*_signals`, reading
   `context.houses[h].sign_lord`; we reuse the *signal-extraction* idea but write a clean **inverse**
   scorer and do **not** import the quarantined heuristic `dasha/scoring.py`.)
4. **Discriminator (secondary):** at the event date, is a slow transiting graha (Jupiter/Saturn) in or
   aspecting the category's house-from-lagna? `calculate_transit_context(natal, birth_dt,
   transit_instant=<event_date>)` exposes `house_from_lagna` (ascendant-dependent). `house_from_moon`
   and Sade-Sati are ascendant-invariant and so do not help *sign* discrimination — exclude from the
   discriminating score (may still display as context).
5. **De-correlation:** cap the contribution per category and down-weight clustered same-signature
   events, so repeating one astrological signature cannot inflate confidence (the
   double-counted-correlated-events failure mode from the external analysis).
6. Aggregate per-candidate scores → rank → compute the **margin** (top − runner-up, normalized) →
   map margin to a qualitative **band**. Emit per-event evidence with machine signal keys.

### 2. Candidate generation

- **Cusp mode:** binary-search the exact sign-boundary-crossing time on the birth day (on Lagna
  longitude); the two candidates = the as-recorded sign and `lagna_adjacent_sign`, each represented by
  a time inside its arc.
- **Window / unknown mode:** coarse-to-fine. Coarse pass samples one representative time per rising
  sign across the plausible range (whole day for unknown; ±margin from `TIME_CONFIDENCE` for rough) and
  ranks signs; an optional fine pass refines the representative time within the winning sign, clearly
  labeled "sign-level, not minute-level."

### 3. Compute strategy on the single Pyodide worker

- **One** `computeRectification` round-trip — the engine sweeps candidates internally; we do **not**
  fire N `generateChart` calls from JS (no batch/cancel/priority exists at the worker; one round-trip
  with a warm ephemeris is far cheaper).
- While the wizard is open, **gate the auto-predictive job** (`usePredictiveLayer({ auto: true })`) so
  the ~35 s predictive compute doesn't block the worker; resume after.
- Two-phase call (fast coarse → optional fine) gives honest progress + a timer like the predictive one.
- Cancel-on-unmount discards results (the worker has no abort; discarding is acceptable and cannot
  corrupt the persisted chart, which only changes via the explicit confirm path).

### 4. Wizard UX — dedicated `/rectify/:profileId`

Reachable from three places that are dead-ends today:
- onboarding's unknown-time path (`needsRectification`, set in `packages/store/src/onboarding.ts` but
  never acted on),
- the ProfileSettings rectification panel (`apps/web/src/pages/settings/ProfileSettings.tsx`),
- the dashboard cusp callout (`IdentityStrip`).

Steps:
1. **Intro / honesty** — what this does and does not do; auto-detects mode (near-cusp → cusp; unknown
   / rough → window).
2. **Events entry** — structured rows: date picker + category dropdown (localized `EventType`) +
   optional **private note that never leaves the device**. Add / edit / delete rows. Optional "paste
   your story" accelerator: the LLM pre-fills reviewable rows behind the cloud opt-in + an explicit
   "this text goes to your AI endpoint" warning; the user reviews/edits before fitting. Min-events
   guidance.
3. **Fit** — runs `computeRectification`; progress + honest timer.
4. **Results** — ranked candidates with qualitative band, per-event evidence table, the margin, the
   honesty line, the recorded-time comparison (reuse `BirthTimeComparison`), the cusp caveat. **No %.**
5. **Confirm** — pick a candidate or keep the recorded time. Accept → emit `birth-info-changed` with
   the representative time → existing `useRegenerationSubscription` → `regenerateOnBirthChange` →
   rectified becomes authority, `birth_time_original` preserved. Reuse `RegenerationConfirmModal`
   sign-flip acknowledgement when the rising sign changes.

### 5. Contract changes (Python → SiderealChart-style → shared-types → store → UI)

- **Python:** new `rectification/` module; `RectificationResult / RectificationCandidate /
  EventEvidence` Pydantic models; `edge/chart_runtime.py::compute_rectification`. Reuse `EventType`.
- **`@almamesh/shared-types`:** the result types + a `LifeEventCategory` union mirroring `EventType`.
- **`@almamesh/browser`:** `pyodide/rectification.ts` + `ChartEngine.computeRectification`.
- **`@almamesh/store`:** `adapters/rectification.ts` (pure reshape) + a transient `useRectificationStore`
  (a derivation, not persisted). **Extend `lifeEvents.ts`:** `LifeEvent` gains a **required** `date` and
  `category: LifeEventCategory`, plus optional `note`; bump `LIFE_EVENTS_PERSIST_VERSION` and migrate
  the old single free-text blob → one uncategorized row flagged for the user to structure; add
  `editEvent` / `removeEvent(id)` CRUD (today only `setEvents` / `addEvent` / `clearEvents`).
- **`@almamesh/llm`:** optional `structureLifeEvents(text, language) -> { events: [{date, category,
  confidence}] }` via `chatCompletionJson` (`response_format: json_object`, wrapped object) following
  the `mesh-reading.ts` parse-with-safe-default template; a new `RECTIFICATION_FENCE` constant in
  `prompt.ts` ("rectify to choose, not we-found-your-true-time; confidence is a hypothesis, never a
  verdict; structure events only — never compute or interpret astrology"); reuse `withLanguage` i18n.

### Data models (shape, finalized in implementation)

```
# Python (Pydantic) → mirrored in @almamesh/shared-types
RectificationCandidate {
  ascendant_sign: ZodiacSign
  representative_time_local: str        # HH:MM, representative — NOT a precise claim
  lagna_longitude_deg: float
  lagna_cusp_distance_deg: float        # reuse Phase-1 field
  is_near_cusp: bool
  fit_score: float                      # raw, exposed for transparency
  supporting_events: list[EventEvidence]
}
EventEvidence {
  event_index: int
  category: EventType
  date: date
  signals: list[str]                    # machine keys, e.g. "dasha_lord_rules_7th", "jupiter_transit_7th"
  contribution: float
}
RectificationResult {
  mode: "cusp" | "window"
  candidates: list[RectificationCandidate]   # ranked, best first
  margin: float                              # normalized top − runner-up
  band: "near_tie" | "leans" | "consistent"
  discriminating_event_count: int
  recorded_time_sign: ZodiacSign | None      # what the as-recorded time yields
  honesty_note_key: str                      # i18n key, not baked prose
}

# Frontend store (IndexedDB, per profile) — extended
LifeEvent { id: string; date: string; category: LifeEventCategory; note?: string; createdAt: string }
```

### 6. Error handling

- Engine failure → retryable in-app, never a dead-end (engine-recovery invariant; reuse `reboot()` /
  `whenReady()`).
- Too few discriminating events → honest "can't distinguish — add more dated events or rely on your
  recorded time."
- LLM assist failure / opt-out → manual entry remains fully functional (LLM is strictly optional).
- Near-tie → both candidates + the recorded time shown; labeled hypothesis.
- Unmount / cancel → discard transient results; the persisted chart is untouched.

### 7. Test plan (TDD, per slice)

- **Backend:** golden-fixture rectification on the synthetic Bengaluru cusp native — synthetic events
  that *should* discriminate one sign → assert the right sign + band; non-discriminating events →
  assert `near_tie`; assert the min-events gate. Determinism with pinned `reference_date`. Pyodide==
  CPython parity for `compute_rectification`.
- **Scorer units:** category→house map, dasha-lord match, transit corroboration, de-correlation cap,
  margin→band mapping, min-events gate.
- **Frontend:** `lifeEvents` migration + CRUD; adapter reshape; wizard component tests **asserting no
  "%" is rendered and the honesty note + recorded time are present**; engine-retry test.
- **i18n:** 3-way key parity for all new keys + the `verify-i18n` live check.
- **Live end-to-end** (project Playwright Chromium, production build — module Workers need it): enter
  events → fit → honest ranked result → confirm → rectified chart authoritative with both times +
  clean console; plus the unhappy paths (engine slow/fail → recover; too-few-events).
- **PII:** grep every agent diff before commit; synthetic fixtures only.

## Reuse map (anchors for implementers)

- Ascendant math + cusp fields: `backend/src/almamesh/calculations.py` (`_cusp_proximity` ~:493,
  `calculate_sidereal_context` ~:668), `schemas/astrology.py:84-89`.
- Forward signal-extraction to mirror (do NOT import scoring): `dasha/vimshottari.py`
  `_extract_vim_*_signals`; event taxonomy `constants/astrology.py:51`.
- Transit-at-date: `transits/__init__.py:46` `calculate_transit_context(..., transit_instant=...)`.
- Engine entry pattern to mirror: `edge/chart_runtime.py` (`compute_predictive`, `compute_mesh`).
- Live preview primitive: `apps/web/src/hooks/useLagnaPreview.ts`.
- Authority pipeline: `packages/store/src/regenerate.ts` (`regenerateOnBirthChange`),
  `packages/store/src/events.ts` (`birth-info-changed`), `hooks/useRegenerationSubscription.ts`.
- Reusable UI: `BirthTimeComparison.tsx`, `RegenerationConfirmModal.tsx`,
  `lib/rectification.ts` (`rectificationDeltaFromClocks`), `lib/lagnaCusp.ts` (`cuspInfo`).
- Events store to extend: `packages/store/src/lifeEvents.ts`.
- Time confidence: `packages/constants/src/astrology.ts:90` (`TIME_CONFIDENCE`).
- LLM structuring reuse: `packages/llm/src/client.ts:106` (`chatCompletionJson`),
  `mesh-reading.ts` (parse-with-safe-default template), `prompt.ts` (fence constants).
- i18n catalogs + gates: `apps/web/src/locales/{en,es,pt}/*`, `*.parity.test.ts`,
  `scripts/verify-i18n.mjs`.

## Build slices

1. **Contract + store + entry UI:** shared-types result/category types; extend `lifeEvents` (date +
   category required, note, migration, CRUD); structured event-entry UI (no fit yet).
2. **Engine scorer + cusp mode + results + confirm:** the inverse scorer, cusp-candidate generation,
   `compute_rectification`, browser/store wiring, results UI with honest bands, confirm → authority.
   *Closes the original two-reports trigger.*
3. **Window / unknown-time sweep:** coarse-to-fine candidate generation + progress + two-phase compute
   + the auto-predictive gating.
4. **Optional LLM assist:** `structureLifeEvents` + `RECTIFICATION_FENCE` + the "paste your story"
   accelerator behind the cloud opt-in.

i18n (3-way), tests, and live validation ride each slice.

## Risks / open questions (resolve during implementation)

- **Category→house map fidelity.** Seed above; finalize with classical citations in the scorer and a
  unit test per category. Keep it conservative; prefer fewer, well-grounded houses per category.
- **Band thresholds.** `near_tie` vs `leans` vs `consistent` cutoffs on the normalized margin are a
  calibration choice; pick defensible defaults, expose as named constants, and bias toward calling
  `near_tie` (under-claiming is the safe failure).
- **Compute time for the full-day window sweep** on Pyodide. Coarse pass is one chart per sign (≤12);
  acceptable. Validate real wall-clock in the live gate; if too slow, cap signs by plausibility.
- **Min-events threshold.** Start at ≥3 discriminating events to leave `near_tie`; tune with fixtures.
