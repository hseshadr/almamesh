/**
 * Seal each life domain's calibrated strength summary into an offline-verifiable
 * Ed25519 receipt — in TypeScript, on the main Worker thread, NOT inside Pyodide.
 *
 * WHY TypeScript and not the Python kernel: the Python `avow` envelope signs via
 * PyNaCl, whose `_sodium` compiled extension does not register under this app's
 * Pyodide boot (plain `nacl`, `cffi` and `_cffi_backend` all load; only the
 * compiled dylib fails, immediately after `loadPackage`). Rather than fight an
 * unresolved loader defect, signing moves to `@edgeproc/avow` — the same envelope,
 * pure JS (`@noble/ed25519` + RFC-8785 JCS), byte-compatible with the Python
 * kernel. The engine stays pure computation in both runtimes and the browser boot
 * stops paying for a crypto dylib it cannot load anyway.
 *
 * "Byte-compatible" is PROVEN, not asserted: `testdata/vectors/` holds receipts
 * minted by the Python kernel, and `__tests__/strengthReceipt.test.ts` requires
 * this module to reproduce them signature-for-signature (and to verify Python's
 * own receipts). Both language suites read that one file.
 *
 * WHAT A RECEIPT DOES AND DOES NOT CLAIM. The signing key is generated per Worker
 * boot and never leaves the device, so it does NOT survive a reload. A receipt is
 * therefore TAMPER-EVIDENCE for a stored or exported summary — mutate a
 * `strength_pct` after the fact and verification fails — and NOT an attestation of
 * who computed it. A browser cannot keep a secret from its own operator, so a
 * shipped shared key would only manufacture a forgeable identity that LOOKS
 * authoritative. Device-local is the honest local-first primitive.
 *
 * The receipt introduces NO number of its own: the payload is the engine's
 * `StrengthSummary` verbatim. The no-fake-precision covenant gains a proof
 * without gaining a claim.

 * - `SignerMismatch` — a PROVENANCE failure: the receipt's embedded key is not
