/**
 * The embedding Web Worker: runs a Transformers.js feature-extraction pipeline
 * (`Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) entirely in-browser, off the UI thread, and
 * returns L2-normalized sentence embeddings.
 *
 * ZERO-EGRESS / OFFLINE CONTRACT — read before changing the `env` config:
 *   The model weights MUST be self-hosted, same-origin, under the app's
 *   `public/models/` so the bytes never touch the HuggingFace CDN. A model CDN
 *   would break offline use and leak usage the same way a font CDN once did.
 *   - `env.allowRemoteModels = false`  -> never fetch from the HF Hub.
 *   - `env.allowLocalModels  = true`   -> load weights from the same origin.
 *     In `@huggingface/transformers` v3, setting `allowRemoteModels = false`
 *     WITHOUT also setting `allowLocalModels = true` leaves BOTH disabled and the
 *     runtime fails closed with "both local and remote models are disabled" —
 *     silently degrading RAG/search to a no-op. Both flags are required.
 *   - `env.localModelPath = "/models/"` -> load weights from the same origin,
 *     i.e. `public/models/Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/...`.
 *   - `env.backends.onnx.wasm.wasmPaths = "/models/ort/"` -> the onnxruntime-web
 *     wasm binaries are self-hosted too (no jsDelivr fallback).
 *   - `env.backends.onnx.wasm.numThreads = 1` -> the self-hosted onnxruntime-web
 *     build is the threaded JSEP wasm, which needs SharedArrayBuffer → cross-
 *     origin isolation (COOP/COEP). The static preview/PWA host is NOT cross-
 *     origin-isolated, so a multi-thread session fails to spawn worker threads.
 *     One thread keeps the model loading on every host.
 *   The apps/web setup script (WS5) places these files; this worker only reads
 *   them. This module is exercised in live e2e, NOT in unit tests.
 *
 * The heavy `@huggingface/transformers` import is confined to this file so the
 * unit-tested modules (chunk/cosine/vectorStore/index) never load the runtime.
