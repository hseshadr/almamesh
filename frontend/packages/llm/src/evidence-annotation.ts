// The model-call side of the evidence-backed report.
//
// WHAT THIS IS. The deterministic layer (`apps/web/src/lib/evidence/`) computes
// every Observation in a chart, its Evidence, its Confidence and its Alternative
// — with no model involved. This module asks a language model to do the ONE
// thing it is allowed to do: attach interpretation prose to an observation the
// engine ALREADY made. The model never authors an observation, never computes a
// placement, never decides what is true.
//
// WHY THE FENCE IS THIS TIGHT. An Evidence block makes any sentence LOOK derived.
// Print "protect your energy rather than giving it away" under a heading that
// says Evidence and Confidence, and the reader takes it for chart-derivation
// whether or not a single computed value went into it — plausible wisdom
// laundered into apparent rigour. So a statement citing an id this chart does not
// contain is DISCARDED, and the prompt says so plainly.
//
// WHERE VALIDATION LIVES: not here. `lib/evidence/annotations.ts` is the single
// validation site, and it is un-bypassable by construction. This module returns
// the RAW parsed payload — bogus ids included — precisely so there is exactly one
// place that decides what renders. Two copies of that rule would eventually
// disagree, and the disagreement would be invisible.
//
// Privacy is enforced the same way every other call in this package enforces it:
// `ensurePrivacy(config)` runs BEFORE anything is built or sent, and the chart
// must already be a `SanitizedChart` — the type IS the boundary.
