// Structured THREE-section mesh edge reading — the AI voice for a relationship
// between two charts, run entirely client-side against any OpenAI-compatible
// endpoint (no backend).
//
// Reuses the section-fanout machinery style of ./structured-interpretation.ts:
// three independent JSON chat completions in parallel — `connection` (how the
// charts meet), `timing_together` (the joint dasha windows), `care` (frictions
// and how to tend them) — each requesting STRICT JSON for one TitledPersona
// { title, layman, technical }, merged into one `MeshReading`. A failed section
// degrades to its safe empty default with an `error` event; ALL sections
// failing throws loudly. The schema here is tiny (three string fields), so one
// prompt set serves both cloud and local models — no LITE variant needed.
//
// The edge is sanitized via `sanitizeMeshEdgeForLlm` BEFORE any prompt is
// built, so the pair privacy boundary cannot be skipped: month-precision dates
// only, both people as roles ("you" / "your spouse"), never names. Every call
// also runs the fail-closed `ensurePrivacy` gate.
