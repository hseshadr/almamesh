/**
 * The bulletproof escape hatch for a stranded client: wipe every source of
 * stale state that can strand a returning visitor or a fail-closed engine boot —
 * a stale service worker, a stale precache, persisted stores written by an older
 * schema, and the synced signed bundle: the @edgeproc/browser OPFS cache
 * (chunks, manifests, the durable active pointer) plus its IndexedDB rollback
 * floor. Everything else in the origin's OPFS (e.g. the chat-memory SQLite
 * file) is swept too, consistent with this reset deleting every IndexedDB
 * database and CacheStorage cache.
 *
 * SECURITY — why wiping the rollback floor here is sound: the durable active
 * pointer is an anti-rollback floor, so an origin that re-publishes at a lower
 * sequence (or a local dev re-sign) makes every boot fail closed with a
 * `RollbackError` until that floor is gone. An EXPLICIT user reset returns this
 * device to first-install trust: the next pointer is still verified against the
 * pinned ed25519 key, exactly as for a brand-new visitor — it just has no floor.
 * That is the same trust a new user has, and it takes a deliberate click. This
 * module must NEVER be invoked automatically in response to a `RollbackError`
 * (or any integrity failure): an auto-clear would let an attacker who can serve
 * an older signed bundle trigger the wipe and defeat rollback protection. The
 * automatic self-heal paths (`swSelfHeal.ts`, `lazyWithRetry`, chunk-error
 * recovery) deliberately do NOT touch OPFS and preserve the `*-immutable`
 * engine caches. When the failure IS a rollback refusal, every reset surface
 * wraps this in `RollbackResetGuard` (tampering warning + two-step confirm).
 *
 * Each cleanup path is isolated in its own try/catch so one failure (a blocked
 * unregister, a locked database) can never stop the others. This module is the
 * single source of truth for the reset — reused by both the global ErrorBoundary
 * and the onboarding error card so the two can never drift apart.
 *
 * Note: this only CLEARS state. Callers decide whether to reload afterwards
 * (`void resetAppData().finally(() => window.location.reload())`).
