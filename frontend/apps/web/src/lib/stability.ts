/**
 * Stable-vs-lagna markers — the TS mirror of `almamesh.rectification.stability`.
 *
 * A {@link StabilityMarker} is a deterministic FACT about ONE report claim (a
 * yoga or a life domain): does its verdict survive BOTH candidate ascendants
 * that birth-time rectification could pick? `holdsUnderBoth: true` = "birth-time
 * stable" (the verdict does not depend on the exact birth time); `false` =
 * "birth-time sensitive". It is honestly certain — a comparison of two charts,
 * never a model estimate.
 *
 * Two ways to build markers, both pure:
 *   • {@link diffMarkers} — the exact diff (mirror of the Python `yoga_markers`
 *     / `domain_markers`): a verdict is stable iff present in BOTH candidate
 *     charts and identical. Used when the alternate-lagna verdicts are in hand.
 *   • {@link reportStabilityMarkers} — the RENDER-TIME conservative default: the
 *     report is computed for ONE lagna, so when that lagna sits on a sign cusp
 *     (a live alternate ascendant, whole-sign houses would rotate) every
 *     house-based verdict is flagged birth-time-sensitive; otherwise the
 *     ascendant is unambiguous and every verdict is stable. It never claims a
 *     stability it cannot back.
 *
 * The claim-id format (`yoga:<name>` / `domain:<domain>`) is byte-identical to
 * the Python module, so a future live dual pass can feed either producer.
