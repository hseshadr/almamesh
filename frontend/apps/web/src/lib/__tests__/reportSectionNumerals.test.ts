/**
 * reportSectionNumerals — the two surfaces must agree on what Section VIII is.
 *
 * The report is rendered twice: on screen by `components/features/report/*` and
 * on paper by `components/report-pdf/*`. Each used to hardcode its own roman
 * numerals, in its own file, with nothing comparing them. Inserting "Evidence &
 * Confidence" renumbered the PDF and left the screen untouched, so the same
 * section printed as VIII in the export and XII on screen — and five sections
 * after it disagreed too.
 *
 * `lib/reportSections.ts` now declares each numeral ONCE. This test holds both
 * surfaces to it: the screen reads its numerals from the registry (so it cannot
 * drift by construction), and every locale's PDF eyebrow string is checked to
 * carry the SAME numeral, in all three languages. Renumber one surface alone and
 * this fails by section name.
