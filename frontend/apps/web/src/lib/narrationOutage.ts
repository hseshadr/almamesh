/**
 * How the OPTIONAL AI narration is unavailable.

 * The chart is deterministic and computed entirely on-device: ascendant, moon,

 * The written interpretation is an enhancement layered on top. So a provider
 * problem is NOT a broken product — it is one optional extra being unavailable,
 * and the UI must say so calmly, with the next step that actually fixes THAT
 * mode. This module is the single place that decides which mode a typed failure
 * belongs to, so the copy and the affordances stay in lockstep.
