/**
 * The evidence ledger — the ONE way a rendered evidence table gets built.
 *
 * This is the un-bypassable seam. `buildEvidenceLedger` is the only exported
 * path from raw model output to something a renderer can draw, and it runs
 * `validateAnnotations` internally. There is no "skip validation" argument and
 * no second constructor: to render an interpretation beside an Evidence block,
 * that interpretation must have named an observation this chart actually
 * produced.
 *
 * With no model output at all (no API key, a failed call, a user who never asked
 * for a reading) the ledger is still complete: every row keeps its Observation,
 * Evidence, Confidence and Alternative, and only the Interpretation cell is
 * empty. The deterministic report loses nothing by having no model.
