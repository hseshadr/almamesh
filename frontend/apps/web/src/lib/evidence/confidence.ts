/**
 * The confidence model.
 *
 * A "Confidence: High" that a model asserted, or that a rule type carries as a
 * hardcoded label, is FAKE PRECISION: it looks more rigorous than a bare claim
 * while being LESS checkable, because a reader cannot reproduce it. So nothing
 * here is assigned. Confidence is DERIVED, in two steps, from values the report
 * already prints beside the claim.
 *
 * STEP 1 - THE CEILING, from how the cited factors were computed.
 *
 *   arithmetic -> High      The number IS the computation. A dasha period is the
 *                           Moon's nakshatra fraction scaled by a declared year
 *                           length; a second implementation gets the same answer.
 *   rule       -> Moderate  Exact arithmetic, but WHICH rule is a classical
 *                           choice: which sign exalts a graha, what orb makes it
 *                           combust, which house system counts. Schools differ.
 *   model      -> Low       A calibrated STRUCTURAL estimate over the +-1 mark
 *                           lattice - a quantity this engine defined, not one
 *                           the tradition hands down. The report already labels
 *                           these STRUCTURAL ESTIMATE, and this is the same
 *                           admission expressed as a number.
 *
 * A claim's ceiling is the MINIMUM over everything it cites. Citing one exact
 * fact and one estimate gets you the estimate's ceiling: a conclusion is only as
 * good as its weakest support.
 *
 * STEP 2 - DEDUCTIONS, from what is fragile IN THIS CHART.
 *
 * Each deduction is one named, measured condition that must be TRUE OF THIS
 * CHART and must TOUCH THIS CLAIM's cited factors. That is what makes the model
 * chart-specific rather than a label per rule type: the identical conclusion
 * scores differently in a chart with a securely-placed ascendant.
 *
 *   lagna-fork          The ascendant is within CUSP_THRESHOLD_DEG of a sign
 *                       boundary AND this claim cites something house-dependent.
 *                       Under whole-sign houses the flip is total - every house
 *                       moves at once - so the claim's whole basis forks.
 *   sign-boundary       A cited dignity or position sits within
 *                       BOUNDARY_MARGIN_DEG of a sign edge, where dignity and
 *                       sign-lord both change.
 *   combustion-boundary A cited combustion verdict sits within
 *                       BOUNDARY_MARGIN_DEG of its own orb, so the verdict is
 *                       one convention away from flipping.
 *   net-zero-marks      A cited structural strength has net_marks = 0, which the
 *                       lattice produces BOTH when favourable and unfavourable
 *                       factors genuinely cancel AND when nothing fired at all.
 *                       The number cannot tell those apart.
 *
 * level = clamp(ceiling - (number of deductions), Low, High).
 *
 * Every input to that arithmetic is printed next to the claim: the cited ids
 * with their class, the ceiling, and each deduction with its measured margin. A
 * reader can recompute the level. That is the whole point - reproducible beats
 * authoritative.
