/**
 * The citation validator — the anti-hallucination guard. It FAILS CLOSED.
 *
 * THE TRAP THIS EXISTS TO CLOSE. An Evidence block makes any sentence LOOK
 * derived. Put "protect your time, energy and money rather than giving them away
 * too freely" under a heading that says Evidence and Confidence, and a reader
 * will take it for chart-derivation whether or not a single computed value went
 * into it. That is strictly worse than plain prose: it launders plausible wisdom
 * into apparent rigour. Wrong AND authoritative-looking.
 *
 * So the model is not allowed to author observations. The deterministic layer
 * computes them (`observations.ts`) and hands the model a list of ids; the model
 * may only ATTACH prose to an id that already exists. Two outcomes, and no third:
 *
 *   REJECTED — the annotation names an observation id (or an extra citation)
 *              that is not in this chart. The prose does not render anywhere.
 *              Not downgraded, not shown with a warning: a statement that
 *              asserts a derivation which did not happen has forfeited its
 *              place. Promoting it to "general guidance" would reward the
 *              hallucination by still printing it.
 *
 *   GENERAL   — the model DECLARED the statement ungrounded by putting it in
 *   GUIDANCE   `general_guidance` instead. That is honest, so it is kept — but
 *              rendered in a visually separate section with NO evidence, NO
 *              confidence and NO alternative beside it. A vague evidence block
 *              is worse than none; this is the "or not at all" alternative,
 *              taken as "clearly separate" because deleting it would hide from
 *              the reader that the model was talking rather than the chart.
 *
 * Rejections are COUNTED and surfaced in Assumptions & Provenance, so a drop is
 * never silent even though the text never appears.
 *
 * UN-BYPASSABLE BY CONSTRUCTION: `buildEvidenceLedger` is the only way to build
 * a renderable ledger, and it runs this validation internally. There is no path
 * from raw model output to the document that does not pass through here.
