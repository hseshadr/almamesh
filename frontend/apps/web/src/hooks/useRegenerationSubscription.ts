/**
 * Subscribe the ONE chart-regeneration handler to `birth-info-changed`.
 *
 * Onboarding and Settings EMIT `birth-info-changed`; this is the single place
 * the chart is (re)computed — replacing the duplicated inline sequences that
 * caused the orphan / dropped-`profile_id` / stale-interpretation bugs.
 *
 * RACE-PROOF against emit-before-subscribe: the in-browser engine bootstraps
 * asynchronously, and the onboarding warming-race / post-`reboot()` recovery
 * paths emit `birth-info-changed` the instant the engine resolves — which can
 * land BEFORE this subscriber sees the ready engine on its next render. The old
 * effect early-returned `if (!engine)` and attached the listener only once the
 * engine was non-null, so that early emit fired into the void and the dashboard
 * showed "Unable to Load Chart". Here the listener is ALWAYS attached (it reads
 * the engine from a ref), so a live event is computed the moment the engine is
 * ready and BUFFERED otherwise; a ready-transition effect then DRAINS the buffer
 * exactly once. No dropped compute, regardless of ordering.
