/**
 * Bind the SPA's wheel READ-list to the publisher's wheel SET.
 *
 * WHY this exists (the scar): `readRuntimeConfig().wheelPaths` tells the engine
 * which files to pull out of the signed bundle. The publisher decides what is
 * actually IN that bundle — it vendors every `backend/offline_wheels/*.whl` plus
 * the built almamesh wheel. Those are two halves of ONE contract with nothing
 * holding them together.
 *
 * They drifted: when the `avow`/`rfc8785` wheels were dropped from the publisher
 * (strength receipts are signed in TypeScript now, so the Python engine ships no
 * crypto), this list kept asking for them. The bundle sync SUCCEEDED — 552 chunks,
 * correct manifest hash — and then the very next read failed closed with
 * `file wheels/rfc8785-0.1.4-py3-none-any.whl not in manifest`. The engine boot
 * aborted before the Pyodide worker was even spawned, so the NATAL chart broke at
 * onboarding, surfacing as the generic `CHART_GEN_001` error screen.
 *
 * Every unit gate was green. Only the 3-minute real-onboarding e2e caught it.
 * This test makes the same drift fail in milliseconds, at the right layer.
