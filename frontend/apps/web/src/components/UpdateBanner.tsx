/**
 * Banner shown when a new version of the app is available.
 *
 * Two signals, one prompt:
 *   - `/version.json` changed (polled by {@link useVersionCheck}) — in practice
 *     the ONLY trigger that fires for a returning visitor;
 *   - the Service Worker has a freshly precached shell waiting (`needRefresh`).
 *     This was assumed to be the authoritative trigger, and is not: Chromium
 *     does not re-check sw.js on these navigations, so nothing ever reaches
 *     `waiting` on its own. Measured, see lib/swUpdate.ts.
 *
 * BOTH triggers must therefore take the SAME action, and that action has to
 * re-check for a new worker itself. They used to differ: a banner raised by the
 * poller ran a bare `window.location.reload()`, which cannot activate a waiting
 * worker — so the reload landed on the same stale build, forever. Since the
 * poller was the only trigger that ever fired, there was no working path at all.
 *
 * The cached engine data in OPFS is untouched by an update.

// z-[60] on purpose. The app chrome — LandingNav's `sticky top-0 z-50` header,
// dialogs, the chat panel — all sit at z-50 and come LATER in the DOM, so an
// equal z-index loses the tie and paints over this banner: on the landing route
// it was invisible AND unclickable, which is why "clicking the banner did
// nothing". A prompt nobody can reach is not a prompt. Keep new chrome below 60.
