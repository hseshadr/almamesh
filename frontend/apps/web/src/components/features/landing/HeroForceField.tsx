 * - `aria-hidden` — the canvas is pure atmosphere; the hero's meaning lives in
 *   the headline/subhead text, so it is hidden from assistive tech.
 * - Honors `prefers-reduced-motion` — renders nothing animated for reduced-motion
 *   users (a calm static gradient shows through from the hero behind it).
 * - SSR/prerender-safe (Spec 064): with no `window` (the build-time Node
 *   prerender of the landing), render the static gradient and NEVER mount the
 *   lazy scene — `React.lazy` would otherwise kick off the three.js/R3F chunk
