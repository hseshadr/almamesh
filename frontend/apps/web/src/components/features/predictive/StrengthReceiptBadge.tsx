/**
 * StrengthReceiptBadge / StrengthReceiptPanel — surface the SIGNED, offline-
 * verifiable per-domain strength receipt ON SCREEN, not only on the silent PDF
 * export path.
 *
 * These wrap the shared, framework-agnostic `@edgeproc/receipt-ui` views as the
 * engine and add exactly the almamesh-specific layer: the injected
 * `verifyDomainStrength` verifier, the pinned per-boot signer key, and a
 * covenant-respecting payload body that shows the calibrated BAND + tier — never
 * a fabricated percentage. The no-fake-precision covenant gains a VISIBLE proof
 * without gaining a claim.
 *
 * WHAT IT PROVES. A sealed receipt is TAMPER-EVIDENCE for the stored/exported
 * summary, not an attestation of who computed it: the signer is generated per
 * Worker boot and never leaves the device (see `strengthReceipt.ts`). The badge
 * is fail-closed — only a resolved verify under the pinned key reads "Verified".
 *
 * THE ONE SEAM. `DomainStrengthReceipt` IS `SignedReceipt<DomainStrengthSubject>`
 * by construction, but a named interface has no index signature, so TypeScript
 * cannot see it satisfies the component's `S extends JsonValue` bound. We adapt
 * at the CALL SITE — casting the envelope through `JsonValue`, never touching the
 * published component — the type-level twin of `@almamesh/browser`'s value-level
 * `asJsonSubject` seam.
 *
 * THE SKIN. `@edgeproc/receipt-ui` publishes markup and NO stylesheet, so the
 * consumer owns the look. `StrengthReceiptBadge.css` is that half of the seam —
 * the Observatory palette applied to the library's BEM hooks. Importing it here
 * (rather than from a global stylesheet) keeps the library's class names inside
 * this one directory.
